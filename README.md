We follow the proposal in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.08224.pdf to
emulate a Majorana braiding operation on an Ising chain with ferromagnetic
interaction and a transverse field. Following the mentionned paper, we will
refer to the area of small transverse field in the which the exchange
interaction dominate as being ferromagnetic and the area of large transverse
field as paramagnetic.

Usually braiding is impossible in 1D but here the use of an additional coupler
spin allows to circumvent that limitation.
